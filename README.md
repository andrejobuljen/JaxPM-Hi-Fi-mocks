# Jax EFT forward model

 - Differentiable implementation of the field-level forward model based on EFT
 - Jax version of [Hi-Fi mocks](https://github.com/andrejobuljen/Hi-Fi_mocks)

Check out this [notebook](/notebooks/forward_model_notebook.ipynb) on how to perform 3D field-level inference using NUTS HMC with [NumPyro](https://num.pyro.ai/en/latest/index.html#), varying initial conditions, cosmology and bias parameters.


## Acknowlegdement

This code evolved from [JaxPM](https://github.com/DifferentiableUniverseInitiative/JaxPM).
